# flutter_temi_java_plugin
Flutter Temi Java Plugin for Flutter version 3.1

This Basic Plugin can be used for newer Flutter version, cause

To expand this plugin just add on ``` lib/flutter_temi.dart``` MethodChannel functions calls for
the Java Plugin. In Java self ```android/app/src/main/java/io.flutter.plugins/FlutterTemiPlugin.java```
is the ```MethodCallHandler```
